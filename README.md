# Rutherford COVID-19 Data 

* [Rutherford data](data/csv/rutherford_data.csv) comes from the Rutherford Health Department.
* All other data comes from the [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data), based on reports from state and local health agencies.

On Friday March 18th, 2022 the Borough began reporting COVID cases weekly instead of daily. As we have continued to monitor the spread of COVID through the town and region, we have decided to no longer report local cases. Rutherford case counts have proportionally followed Bergen County case counts. For continued monitoring of the spread of COVID in the region we suggest following Bergen County information through the State of New Jersey reporting site, or sites such as Covid Act Now.

The Rutherford health department will continue monitoring COVID-19 cases. In the event that the numbers do not align with Bergen County, a notification will be sent out to the Rutherford residents.
